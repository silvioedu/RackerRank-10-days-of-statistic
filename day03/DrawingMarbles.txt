Question: A bag contains  red marbles and  blue marbles.
          Then,  marbles are drawn from the bag, at random, without replacement.
          If the first marble drawn is red, what is the probability that the second marble is blue?

Marbles:
FR = first red
FB = first blue
SR = second red
SB = second blue

# Permutation
total number of outcomes: 2P7 = 7! / (7-2)! = 7 * 6 = 42
number of outcomes in event (FR and SB): 3 * 4 = 12

probability:
P(FR) = 3/7
P(FR and SB) = 12 / 42 = 2/7

# Conditional Probability
P(SB | FR) = P(SB and FR) / P(FR)
= P(FR and SB) / P(FR)
= 2/7 / 3/7
= 2/3
