Question: In a single toss of 2 fair (evenly-weighted) six-sided dice, find the probability that the values rolled by
          each die will be different and the two dice have a sum of 6.

Total Combinations....................: 36
Combinations Different and sum is 6...: 04    -> (1,5) (2,4) (4,2) (5,1)

Solution..............................: 4/36
(simplifying by 5)....................: 1/9
